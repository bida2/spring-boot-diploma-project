# Spring Boot - Diploma Project
Diploma project for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

My first real project with Spring and Java in general, It uses technologies like Java Server Pages (JSP), Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Search, Flyway (database migrations), Bootstrap 4 on the frontend, SendGrid for sending e-mails as well as internationalization. Sadly, there was no time left to optimize the project for mobile devices.

# Project on hold for now
